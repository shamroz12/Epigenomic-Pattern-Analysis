# Epigenomic-Pattern-Analysis
-Used publicly available ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets to study the interplay between chromatin modifications and gene expression regulation. -Explored how non-coding RNAs and epigenetic marks influence transcriptional outcomes, tying this work to RNA processing and cancer transcriptomics.
